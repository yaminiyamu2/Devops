# Jenkins:-
 ->Jenkins is an open-source automation platform that help Devops teams create and test s/w projects. It's used to  
    manage & control several stages of s/w delivery process.including:
                1.Build
                2.Documentation.
                3.Automated Testing.
                4.Packing.
                5.Static code analysis.
 ->Jenkins is written in java & has plugins designed for continous integration.It's used to implement CI/CD workflows,
     called"Pipeline". 

# Build:-
-> Build tools automate the creation of executable applications from source code.Building includes compiling,linking& 
    packaging the code into a usable or executable form.
->Jenkins supports several types of build jobs projects such as free style projects,pipelines,multi-configuration  
     projects,folders,multibranch pipelines & organization folders.

# Plugins:-
-> A Plugin is a s/w component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program.
-> Plugins are the primary means of enhancing the functionality of a jenkins environment to suit   
    organization-or-user-specific needs
    *Build tools,Cloud Providers,Analysis tools*

# CI/CD:-
     The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are "continous integration,continous deelivery/depolyment". CI/CD
  is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development.

# Pipelines:-
    It is a suite of plugins which supports implementing & intergrating continous delivery pipelines into jenkins.
    Pipelines are two types:
        1.Scripted.
        2.Declarative.

# Note:- 
 Jenkins is used by thousands of development teams other DevOps tools.include:
 Git,Docker,Cucumber,Ansible,Teamcity,Nagios............   

# Continuous Integration(CI):-
        CI is a Devops s/w development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central
    repository,after which automated builds and tests are run.
