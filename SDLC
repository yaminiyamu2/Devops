***What is SDLC?
    SDLC is stands for "Software Development Life Cycle".It's a structured process used for developing s/w applications. 
The main phases typically include:

1.Planning:Defining the project  scope,objectives and feasibility.
2.Requirements Gathering:collecting functional and non-functionalrequirement from stakeholders.
3.Design:Creating architectural and designs,including ser interfaces and system interfaces.
4.Implementation:Writing and compiling the code based on the design specification.
5.Testing:Verifing that the s/w meets the specified requirements and identifying any defects.
6.Deployment:Releasing the s/w to users and ensuring it's functioning as expected.
7.Maintenance:Providing ongoing support,bug fixes,and updates as needed.
      Different models os SDLC(Like waterfall,Agile,Spiral)may emphasize these phases differently,but the overall
goal is to ensure a systematic approach to s/w development for quality and efficiency.

What is Waterfall Methodology?
     The waterfall methodology is a project management techniques that involves a series of sequential phases that are completed in order,simila to theflow of waterfall.

    The waterfall methodology is often used in s/w &product development.It's charcterizes by:
1.Regidity:Unlike more flexible methods,the waterfall methodology requires each phases to be completed before the next one can begin.
2.Upfront Planning:The waterfall methodology emphasizes early planing and documentationa to minimize risk and ensure a predictable release data.
3.Visulization:The waterfall methodology is often represented as a flow chart or Grantt chart,which helps to visualize how long each task will take and who is responsible for it.
4.Suitability:The waterfall methodology is a good fit for projects where the end result is clear before the project begins.
              however,it's not recommanded for complex projects because os its inflexibility.
