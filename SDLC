What is SDLC?
--------------
    SDLC is stands for "Software Development Life Cycle".It's a structured process used for developing s/w applications. 
The main phases typically include:
1.Planning:Defining the project  scope,objectives and feasibility.
2.Requirements Gathering:collecting functional and non-functionalrequirement from stakeholders.
3.Design:Creating architectural and designs,including ser interfaces and system interfaces.
4.Implementation:Writing and compiling the code based on the design specification.
5.Testing:Verifing that the s/w meets the specified requirements and identifying any defects.
6.Deployment:Releasing the s/w to users and ensuring it's functioning as expected.
7.Maintenance:Providing ongoing support,bug fixes,and updates as needed.
      Different models os SDLC(Like waterfall,Agile,Spiral)may emphasize these phases differently,
but the overall goal is to ensure a systematic approach to s/w development for quality and efficiency.

What is Waterfall Methodology?
------------------------------
     The waterfall methodology is a project management techniques that involves a series of sequential phases that are completed in order,simila to theflow of waterfall.
Analysis-------
              Design------
                        Implememttation-----
                                           Testing-----
                                                      Maintenance
    The waterfall methodology is often used in s/w &product development.It's charcterizes by:
    ->Regidity: 
         Unlike more flexible methods,the waterfall methodology requires each phases to be completed before the next one can begin.
    ->Upfront Planning:
          The waterfall methodology emphasizes early planing and documentationa to minimize risk and ensure a predictable release data.
    ->Visulization:
          The waterfall methodology is often represented as a flow chart or Grantt chart,which helps to visualize how long each task will take and who is responsible for it.
    ->Suitability:
           The waterfall methodology is a good fit for projects where the end result is clear before the project begins.
              however,it's not recommanded for complex projects because os its inflexibility.

What is Agile methodology?
--------------------------
            Agile methodo;ogy is an itreative s/w development methodology that can be used ti improve the workflow of DevOps.
Agile can help improve collabrations,productivity and efficience when used in conjuction with DevOps.
 ->Agile Sprints:
            Agile breaks work into smaller unites called sprints,which are usually one to four weeks long.each sprint produces a new version of the s/w that can be shipped.
 ->Continuous integration& delivery:
            Devops uses continuous integration to merge code into a shared repository & continuous delivery to deploy to mulitiple environment at once.
 ->Automated Testing:
            Agile DevOps uses automated tools to test code for defects,which helps to find and fix issues quickly.
 ->Improve collabration:
            Agile emphasizes collabration and customer feedback,while DevOps brings together developers and operations teams.
 ->Faster Releases:
            Agile and DevOps both aim to improve the speed & quality of s/w releases.

What is Spiral methodology?
---------------------------
      The Spiral model is a s/w development model in the SDLC that combines the iterative model with elements of the waterfall model.
It's used to manage risk and is often used for large,expensive and complex projects.
The Spiral Model has the following characteristics: 
->Risk management:
            The model is designed to identify and mitigate risks early in the project, which can lower the overall risk.
->Gradual releases:
            The model allows for gradual releases and refinement of the product through each phase.
->Prototypes:
            The model allows for the creation of prototypes at each phase.
->Multiple phases:
            The model has multiple phases,including planning,risk annlysis,development and evaluation.
->Diagram:
            The model is represented as a diagram that looks like a coil with many loops,each representing a phases in the development process.
           The number of loops varies by project  and is often chosen by the project manager.

Phases of SDLC?
----------------
       The phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) typically include the following:
1.Planning: 
   - Define the scope and objectives of the project.
   - Conduct feasibility studies (technical, operational, and financial).
   - Develop a project plan and timeline.
2.Requirements Gathering and Analysis: 
   - Collect and document functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Engage with stakeholders to ensure all needs are understood.
   - Analyze requirements for clarity and feasibility.
3.Design: 
   - Create architectural designs and system models.
   - Develop detailed design specifications, including user interfaces and data structures.
   - Review designs with stakeholders for approval.
4.Implementation (or Coding): 
   - Write the actual code based on the design documents.
   - Conduct code reviews and adhere to coding standards.
   - Integrate components and prepare for testing.
5.Testing: 
   - Perform various types of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance) to ensure quality.
   - Identify and fix bugs or defects.
   - Validate that the software meets all requirements.
6.Deployment: 
   - Release the software to production or the end-users.
   - Conduct user training and support during the rollout.
   - Monitor for any issues post-deployment.
7. Maintenance: 
   - Provide ongoing support and updates to the software.
   - Address any issues that arise and implement enhancements as needed.
   - Plan for future versions or upgrades.
These phases help ensure that the software is developed systematically and meets the intended requirements and quality standards.
Different methodologies may emphasize these phases differently, but they generally follow this sequence.

 How DevOps can improve the SDLC process ?
 -----------------------------------------
DevOps can significantly improve the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process by fostering collaboration, enhancing automation, and promoting continuous integration and delivery.
Hereâ€™s how:
1.Collaboration: 
  ->Cross-functional Teams: 
           DevOps breaks down silos between development and operations, encouraging collaboration among all stakeholders, which leads to better communication and faster resolution of issues.

   ->Adaptability: 
             Teams can respond more rapidly to market changes or user feedback, improving overall agility.
6.Cultural Shift:
   ->Emphasis on Learning and Improvement: 
             DevOps promotes a culture of continuous improvement, where teams learn from failures and successes, leading to better practices over time.
   ->Empowerment and Ownership: 
             Team members are encouraged to take ownership of their work, leading to increased motivation and job satisfaction.
By integrating these practices, DevOps not only improves the efficiency and quality of the SDLC process but also enhances overall product delivery and user satisfaction.
                                           
what is E-commerce?
-------------------
      E-commerce, or electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It encompasses a wide range of online business activities, including:
   ->Online Retail: 
     Selling products directly to consumers through websites or platforms (e.g., Amazon, eBay).
   ->Wholesale and B2B: 
      Businesses selling products or services to other businesses (e.g., Alibaba).
    ->Marketplace Platforms: 
      Websites that facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers (e.g., Etsy, eBay).
    ->Digital Products:
      Selling downloadable products like e-books, software, or online courses.
    ->Subscription Services: 
      Offering products or services on a subscription basis (e.g., Netflix, subscription boxes).
    ->Payment Processing: 
      Facilitating online transactions through payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).
E-commerce has grown rapidly due to its convenience, wide reach, and the ability to operate 24/7. It includes various models, 
such as B2C (business to consumer), B2B (business to business), C2C (consumer to consumer), and C2B (consumer to business).
The sector encompasses not only the sales aspect but also marketing, logistics, and customer service.                                         

What is a Server ?
------------------
        A server in a virtual machine refers to a virtualized instance that acts as a server,running on physical hardware but 
abstacted through virtualization technoligy.
->Isolation:
        Each VM operates in its own isolated environment,allowing multiple servers to run on a single physical machine without interfering with each other.
->Scalability:
        VMs can be quick spun up or down based on demand,making it easier to scale application and services.
->consistency:
        By using VMs, teams can ensure consistent environments across development,testing,production,reducing the "it works on my machine: problem.
->IaC:
        VMs can be manged and provisioned through codee using tools like Terraform/ansible,allowing for automated deployment and configuration.
->Containerization:
        While VMs provide a full operating system environment,they can also host containers(like docker), which are lightweight ans share the host OS,
    further enhancing resource efficiency.
Server in VMs are essencial for creating flexible,scalable and consistent environment in a devops workflow,facilitating faster development cycle and continuous integrating and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

What is VMs?
-------------
    Virtual machines, are s/w-based emulation of physical computers.They allow you to run an operating system and applications in an isolated environment on a host machine.This means you can run multiple operating system ona 
single physical computer,each operating independently.
Key features of VMs include:
->Isolation:Each VMs operates independently,so s/w in one VM doesn't affect others.
->Resource Management:You can allocate CPU,Memory and storage resources to each VM as needed.
->Snapshots:VMs can be paused and saved,allowing you to return to a previous state if something goes wrong.
->Protability:VMs can often be moved b/w different physical machines with relative easee.
     They're commonly used for testing,development,server consolidation and running applications that require different environments.
Advantages:
1.Isolation:Each VM runs in its own environment,ensuring that issues in one do not affect others.
2.Resource Efficiency: Multiple VMs can run on a single physical machine,maximizing hardware utilization.
3.Scalability:VMs can be easily created,cloned,or deleted,allowing for rapid scaling up or down based on demand.
4.Snapshot and Backup:VMs can be saved at a specific state,making it easy to restore or backup system without downtime.
5.Cross-Platform Compatibility:Different opreating system can be run on the same hardware,facilitating testing and development.
6.Cost Saving:Reduces the need for physical hardware,lowering costs related to maintenance,power and space.
7.Security:Isolation helps contain security threats,as breaches in one VM can be consined without affecting others.
8.Testing and Develoment:VMs provide a sofe environment for testing s/w and configurations without risking the primary system.
9.Disaster Recovery:VM can be easily replicated and moved,simplifying disaster recoveery strategies.
10.Easy Management:Centralized management tools allow for straightforward monitoring and administration of multiple VMs.
            These advantages make VMs a popular choice in data centers,development environments and cloud computing.

The main differences b/w physical machines and Virtual machines are:
1.Definition:
  PM:A tangible,hatdware-based computer with its own dedicated resources(CPU,RAM,Storage).
  VM:A s/w-based emulation of a physical machine that runs on a hypervisor,sharing the underlying hardware of the host system.
2.Resource allocation:
  PM:Resource are fixed and dedicated to a single operating system and application.
  VM:Resources can be dynamically allocated and shared among multiple VMs on the same host.
3.Isolation:
  PM:Fully isolated;issues or crashes in one PM do not affect others.
  VM:Also isolated,but issues in one VM can potentially impact the host system or other VMs if not properly manged.
4.Flexibility and Scalability:
  PM:Scaling up requires purchasing additional hardware.
  VM:VMs can be easily created,cloned or deleted, allowing for rapid nscaling based on needs.
5.Management and Maintenance:
  PM:Requires physical maintenance and management(eg:hardware upgrades,physical space)
  VM:Managed through s/w,allowing for easier updates,backups, and snapshots.
6.Cost:
  PM:Higher upfront costs due to hardware purchases and maintenance.
  VM:Typically lower costs,as mulitiple VMs can run on fewer physical servers.
7.Depliyment Time
  PM:Setting up a physical machine can take time for hardware installation and configuration.
  VM:VMs  can be quickly deployed from images or templates, speeding up the process.
8.Disaster Recovery:
  PM:Recovery often involves pysical intervention and backup systems.
  VM:VMs can be backed up and restored easily,facilitating faster disaster recovery.
9.Performance:
  PM:Generally offers better performance for resource-intensive applications due to direct access to hardware.
  VM:May experience slight performance overhead due to virtualization,though this is often minimal with modern hypervisors.

What is a Hypervisor ?
----------------------
        A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host. 
It allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine by abstracting the hardware resources.
There are two main types of hypervisors:
Type 1 (Bare-metal): These run directly on the hardware without a host operating system. They are more efficient and typically used in enterprise environments. 
                     Examples include VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.
Type 2 (Hosted): These run on top of a conventional operating system. They are generally easier to set up and are often used for development and testing. 
                     Examples include VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.
    Hypervisors manage resource allocation, isolation, and communication between VMs, enabling efficient utilization of hardware and improved scalability.
